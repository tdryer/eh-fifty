# eh-fifty

eh-fifty is a Python library for configuring the [Astro A50 wireless headset
and base station (generation 4)][astro-a50].

**Use at your own risk.** eh-fifty was developed using reverse engineering. If
you get into trouble, re-plug your base station and reset your headset by
holding down the "game" and "Dolby" buttons together for 15 seconds.

eh-fifty has only been tested on Linux, although it may work on other platforms
supported by [PyUSB][pyusb].

## Features

* [X] get/set microphone level
* [X] get/set side tone volume
* [X] get/set noise gate mode
* [X] get/set alert volume
* [X] get/set active EQ preset
* [X] get/set EQ preset parameters
* [X] get/set game/voice balance
* [X] save configuration values
* [X] get charging status and battery level
* [X] get headset status
* [X] get EQ preset name
* [ ] update firmware

## Example

Retrieve the current battery charge:

    from eh_fifty import Device
    device = Device()
    battery_status = device.get_battery_status()
    print(f"Battery: {battery_status.charge_percent}%")

## Non-root access

Create a udev rule to allow non-root users to access the USB device:

    echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="9886", ATTR{idProduct}=="002c", MODE="0666"' | \
        sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/50-astro-a50.rules

Re-plug your base station to apply the new rule.

## Protocol Documentation

### Requests

The first byte of a request is `0x02`.

The second byte of a request is a request type (see below).

An optional request payload may follow, prefixed by the length of the payload
in bytes, not including this byte.

### Responses

The first byte of a response is `0x02`.

The second byte of a response may be either:

* `0x00` for "no response"
* `0x01` for "error"
* `0x02` for "success"

Unless the second byte represents "no response", the third byte of a response
is the remaining length of the response measured in bytes, not including this
byte.

### Saved Values

Sending request type `0x61` will save the active configuration. Saved values
can be queried separately from active values. This can be used by applications
to implement an operation to revert to a saved configuration. Changes to the
active configuration effect immediately; saving changes is not required.
